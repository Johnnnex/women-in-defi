              Joining women in Defi was actually one of my best gift the lord
              gave me the year 2022. It changed my life and made me meet a lot
              of important people that i could call sisters. They really make
              the community look like family. I am grateful for having the best
              tutors also.

              I was onboarded into the web3 space by the WID community in April
              this year; that was the best thing that happened to me. Before
              now, I had no knowledge of what web3 is or what the decentralized
              space is all about. <br />
              The only knowledge I had on crypto then was buying low and selling
              high ðŸ˜… <br />A big thank you to the founder of WomenInDefi and
              the core team members, WID was a game changer for me. Today,
              I&apos;m an ardent believer in Decentralized Finance

              The WID team has not only taught me about Defi but also help me
              stand my feet in the decentralized finance space through the
              process of close watch and constant follow-up even after the
              class. After the class, i have been able to get jobs that have
              given me funds to get gadgets to improve my tech journey, funds to
              process admission, and also my upkeep. A big thanks to the team
              for also reaching out and helping.

              WID was the start of my defi journey and the start of my
              millionaire journey. I discovered so many opportunities that i can
              leverage to make myself financially stable in the defi space. The
              biggest motivation is the fact that i&apos;m taught by women who
              have broken records, which gives me the inspiration to do more.
              Then being part of a community that looks out for you can&apos;t
              be overemphasized as it speeds up my growth.

              WID changed my view about blockchain and crypto. A community
              blessed with great tutors that are patient in explaining and
              carrying their students along. My Defi journey has been a great
              one. It all started with #WID

              Determination and WID TEAM are synonymous. Honestly, there&apos;s
              a lot to say about WOMEN IN DEFI (WID) Community, the massive love
              the cooperation, and the active tutors are just what anyone
              can&apos;t get elsewhere. I came in with Zero knowledge but today
              i can say am Good with What i Do. Defi is the future, joining a
              good community is the way forward. <br />
              Thank you Miss Sarah for all the hard work you have put in place
              for the smooth running of the community.
